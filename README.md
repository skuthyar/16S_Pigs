Code associated with "Pig microbial and immune traits respond to host evolutionary history and ecology across multiple scales."

Description: These files will allow you to replicate the analyses we used to assess the impact of domestication on the pig gut microbiome and immune state. 

The following files should be used in order to process raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing data: cutadapt, dada2, decontam, tables, and tree. The output will be an ASV decontaminated counts table, an ASV taxonomy table, and a phylogenetic tree. The R markdown file (Pig_16S.Rmd) will allow you to replicate any statistical analyses and visualizations for 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
